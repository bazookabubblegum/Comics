	<h1><strong>Raven As A Hero And A Villian</strong></h1>
	<p>What most readers and fanatics do not realize about the DC Comic hero Raven, who appeared in the New Teen Titans, and carried over a follow up series, is her movement to initiate the group.
	<br />
	Raven, being the daughter of a demon and a human has uncanny abilities that led her to fight the darkness within her and the world.
	<br />
	Although numerous accounts almost led her to her original roots, she managed to overcome the strength of her father, and although not viewed the same by the group, was still very supported.
	<br />
	This dawned not only a new outfit but a new mission after the group split up to create another group, which then led to meeting Teen Titans East. </p>
