		<h1>Azarath Metrion Zinthos</h1>
		<p>What most readers and fanatics distract from the DC Comic hero Raven, who appeared in the New Teen Titans and carried over a follow up series, was her movement to initiate the group.</font>
		<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Raven</strong>, being the daughter of a demon father and a human mother, has uncanny abilities, of light and dark. 
		<br />
		<br />
		This led her to fight the darkness within her and the world on a mission.
		<br />
		Although numerous accounts almost led her to her original roots, she managed to overcome the strength of her father, and although not viewed the same by the group, was still very supported.
		<br />
		This dawned not only a new outfit but a new mission after the group split up to create another group, which then led to meeting Teen Titans East. </p>

		<h1>The Unseen To be Seen</h1>
		<p>Through a series of enamorous events, The Flash found himself isolated from his family, while still visiting his father in the County Prison. As he grew into understanding hisnew strengths, he created a suit that would allow his body to phase through time and space without injury, as well as not dawning a birthday suit.
		<br />
		He would later find that these strenghts would not only grow to protect and serve, but also give his father hope, and help his team mates out of very sticky situations.</p>
		<br />
		<h2>What Could You Do If You Were Struck By Lightning?</h2>
		<br />
		<p>
		Imagine every fibeerous nerve in your body being
		activated in a split moment and feeling your blood heat up simutaneously while still surviving. Then what?
		Ass kicking time</p>

		<header><strong>Nothing Can Deter A Man On The Path for Peace</strong></header>
		<p>Unless you are Kryptonite of course, a matter found only on this man's birth place.
		<br />
		Clark Kent was child of the Planet Krypton, whose parents died in the attempt to send him to a safer place by capsule during a war. This place being Earth.
		<br />
		Although he grew on a family farm, with adopted parents that wanted only success for him, he ventured towards the call of his heart.
		<br />
		Growing up he dawned amazing skillsets that were unlike his peers on this new planet, making it difficult to fit in. He founded his way to a newspaper and found his life love Louis Lane, a fast track columnist.
		<br />
		He was known to stop bullets, had highly developed capacity for speed and strength and outnumbered any foe merely on his own.
		<br />
		In the character development of Super Man, you see where conflicted heroes join is mission and steer missions of their own.
